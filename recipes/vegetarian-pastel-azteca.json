  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease your round Dutch oven or baking dish.",
    "Slice Peppers and Onions. Grate the Courgette. Sauté peppers/onions in a pan for 5 mins until soft.",
    "Add Grated Courgette, drained Black Beans, Passata, and Fajita Seasoning to the pan. Simmer for 5 mins into a thick stew.",
    "ASSEMBLY: Place a Tortilla in the pot. Spread with a thin layer of Refried Beans. Ladle over 1/4 of the Veggie Stew. Sprinkle cheese.",
    "Repeat layers 3 times. Place final Tortilla on top.",
    "Spread remaining Refried Beans on the TOP tortilla (to prevent burning) and cover with remaining Cheese.",
    "Bake for 25 mins until bubbling and golden. Let stand for 5 mins before slicing."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Moisture Control: We grate courgette into the sauce because as it cooks, it releases water, ensuring the stack stays moist from the inside out.",
    "The 'Glue': Refried beans are essential here. They act as a barrier to stop the sauce soaking into the tortilla too quickly, keeping the layers distinct.",
    "The Gravy: We simmer the veg in passata first to soften the tortillas gently, rather than just using dry fried vegetables which would result in a chewy texture."
