  "steps": [
    "THE RINSE (CRUCIAL): Place rice in a sieve. Wash under cold tap until the water runs CLEAR. This removes starch that causes gluey rice.",
    "Place rinsed rice, Boiling Water, Salt, and Butter in a pot with a tight-fitting lid.",
    "Bring to a boil (this should be fast).",
    "LID ON. Turn heat to LOWEST possible setting. Cook for 12 minutes. NO PEEKING!",
    "Turn heat OFF. Leave the pot on the burner (if gas) or move to a warm spot (if electric). Let STEAM for 10 minutes. Do not remove lid.",
    "Remove lid. Fluff gently with a fork. Serve immediately."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Ratio Rule: For Basmati, use 1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water. For American Long Grain, use 1 cup rice to 1.75 cups water. The recipe above uses the Basmati ratio.",
    "The Steam: The 10-minute steam with the heat off is what finishes the cooking gently. If you skip this, the rice may be wet at the bottom.",
    "No Peeking: Lifting the lid lets the steam escape and ruins the cooking process. Trust the timer!"
