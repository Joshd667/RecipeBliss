  "steps": [
    "If using FRESH: Finely slice the chillies (keep seeds for heat). Place in a small bowl.",
    "If using DRIED: Place flakes in a small bowl.",
    "Squeeze the juice of 2 limes over the chilli. Add a pinch of salt and the oil.",
    "Mix well and press down with a spoon.",
    "Let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. This 'cures' the chilli and extracts the heat into the juice."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Curing: The acid in the lime juice 'cures' fresh chillies, softening their bite, or rehydrates dried flakes so they aren't papery.",
    "Balance: This side is designed to add acid. The main Chilli con Carne is rich and savory; this dressing cuts through that fat for a balanced palate."
