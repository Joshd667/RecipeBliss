  "steps": [
    "Wash and disjoint the chicken into 10 to 12 pieces.",
    "Season the chicken pieces with salt, then place in a pot with the sliced onions, thyme, and curry powder. Cook for 30 to 40 minutes until the chicken is tender.",
    "Blend the large onions, fresh chilli, garlic, and fresh tomatoes into a smooth paste.",
    "Heat half of the groundnut oil in a frying pan and fry the cooked chicken pieces until they are browned but not overly dry. Remove the chicken and set aside.",
    "Heat the remaining groundnut oil in a separate pot and fry the blended onion, chilli, and tomato mixture for 20 minutes until the mixture is fairly dry.",
    "Stir the tomato puree into the sauce, adding a splash of stock if the mixture is too thick.",
    "Return the fried chicken pieces to the sauce. Stir thoroughly, then simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring frequently until the flavors are well blended.",
    "Skim off and drain any excessive oil that rises to the top of the stew.",
    "Remove the pot from the heat, stir in the chopped coriander leaves, and serve hot with boiled rice."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "The Chef's Why: Using groundnut oil instead of standard vegetable oil imparts an authentic, earthy flavor that is essential to the depth of this traditional stew.",
    "Technique: Frying the chicken after boiling seals the outside, giving it a firmer texture so it doesn't fall apart when simmering in the rich tomato sauce.",
    "Alternatives: If you prefer lamb, coat a leg of lamb in the onion and curry spice mix and cook in a slow cooker for 6 to 8 hours until tender, skipping the disjointing and initial boiling step.",
    "Texture Preference: The sauce can be blended at the very end for a completely smooth consistency, but leaving the onions chunky adds a great rustic texture to the final dish."
